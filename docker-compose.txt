Docker engine(UI login -> hub.docker.com ) and cmd login -> docker login -u ganapathi423 both are same user name and pass below
user name -> ganapathi423
pass -> ganapathi@1995

steps for docker image push to docker hub:

1.Login to the docker.

2. docker login -u darlin

Tag your image build

my image name here is mylocalimage and by default it has tag latest and my username is darlin as registered with docker cloud, and I created a public repository named dockerhub
so my personal repository becomes now darlin/dockerhub and I want to push my image with tag myfirstimagepush.

I tagged as below :

docker tag mylocalimage:latest darlin/dockerhub:myfirstimagepush
Pushed the image to my personal docker repository as below

docker push darlin/dockerhub:myfirstimagepush

And it was successfully pushed to my personal docker repo.
